  * Image processing by way of arrays:  This assignment is designed to
  * give you a chance to work with arrays. The fact that we're processing images
  * makes the example interesting, but no prior knowledge of image processing
  * or understanding of the setup for this in hw2ArrayImageProcessingSetup.js
  * is required (though you're welcome to study that if you like!).
  *
  * In each of these functions, you'll be reading the parameter 'original',
  * which is an array of pixel data.  Each array contains four numeric elements to
  * describe each pixel in the image (red, green, blue, alpha).  The
  * data looks like this:
  *   original[0];  // pixel 0 red value
  *   original[1];  // pixel 0 green value
  *   original[2];  // pixel 0 blue value
  *   original[3];  // pixel 0 alpha value
  *   original[4];  // pixel 1 red value
  *   original[5];  // pixel 1 green value
  *   original[6];  // pixel 1 blue value
  *   original[7];  // pixel 1 alpha value
  *     etc...
  *
  * Essentially, your job is to read
  * data from the original array, and copy it to the output array, making
  * certain modifications along the way. It might be a good idea to start by
  * iterating over the original array and coping its data unmodified into the
  * output array. Once you have that working, you can try the data changes
  * required to make the output correct.

 * makeBlue - Reads data from an image bitmap array and writes new image data to a another array object
